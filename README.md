This is a convolutional neural network model to clasify antero-posterior knee radiographs into rheumatoid arthritis or into osteoarthritis.
This model was made using the training dataset containing radiographs of end-stage arthritis.
This model was not developed for any clinical use but for a observational medical study (temporaly use). 
To maintain the data availabilty in our paper, we disclose the model and the function.
